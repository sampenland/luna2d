With "COME BACK HOME" SONG FEEL:
	I feel at peace. I want to flow and manage something. I want to pick berries and place them somewhere
	and I want to build fences and torches to see at night.
	
	I want to plant berry bushes around. Sometimes animals come to the bushes and eat them till they are gone. I
	have to plant more but I can tame the animals, some simply like to be fed while others will fight you.
	
	Right click berries to eat them, left click to plant them somewhere.
	
	
	
	
	
	Theme is the King of all Animals.
	A game like Minecraft and Ark. You start at a random place. You run around for a while and then you
	pick a berry off a bush. You can eat or plant it. You eat a few then plant one. You see you have
	to give water to the plant for it to grow (sometimes it rains and helps). 
	with one berry bush which produces berries. The berry you can either
	eat or plant. Planting means you must run to a water source and carry it back to your berry bush
	as it grows. 
	
	Since maps are grided to worlds which are grided up more...we keep a bush count per smallest chunk of
	existence, the map. A bush eating animal is drawn to maps with the highest bush count. But what follows 
	are predators next. They come to a cow-like animal count per map.
	
	You can build fences around your bushes to keep the clumsy cow like creatures from eating the bush, but
	they still gather around the fences and after bumping into the fence (4 different sprites for damage) the
	fence is destroyed.
	
	You can chop wood from trees to make the fences.
